# My Personal Project

## What Will the Application Do? 
My project will be a music visualization and composition application. 
It will allow users to quickly sketch and further develop musical compositions in a 2d environment 
where the vertical axis represents pitch and the horizontal axis represents time. 
The application will also include helper features such as suggestions, templates, 
and ways to automate manual user input (refactoring). 
The following is a list of specific planned functionality:
- placing, moving, and resizing notes by mouse or keyboard
- note placement constrained to discrete positions in time and pitch
- quick manipulation such as group selection of notes, copying/pasting
- ability for user to define a group of notes as a template
- automatic, viewable analysis of music metacharacteristics, such as chord progression
- ability for user to change a metacharacterstic and have the music change automatically

## Who Will Use It? 
This application will be useful for anyone interested in music/composition, students of music, or composers. 
## Why is the project of interest to me? 
this project is of interest primarily because I am interested in music, being a musician. 
However, I've always been relatively poor at theory and improvisation. Programming an application 
like this will increase my understanding of music, and furthermore challenge and improve my programming 
skills because of the specific demands of the domain. 

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to create a new note with a start time, end time, pitch, and volume, 
adding it to the collection of existing notes.
- As a user, I want to scroll to be able to see the full extent of my composition.
- As a user, I want to be able to select a note and change its characteristics.
